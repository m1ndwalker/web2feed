Web2Feed is a simple tool that takes a specific website, checks if it for new items (or articles) and generates an output for those items. The generated output is essentially a compact list of interesting items to check in the future.

At the moment 2 types out outputs are supported: HTML and RSS.

The tool is plugin driven which means that if you want to support a specific site, you can (with some Python knowledge) implement support for it without need to change the main tool.

This tool depends on BeautifulSoup, html5lib and PyRSSGen
